RESTspec is an off-the-shelf, ready-to-adopt API design guideline for organizations building high quality, consistent API and web resource portfolios.

## Why RESTspec

API quality is important.  Well-crafted APIs are more useful and easier to work with.  They encourage adoption services, speed time-to-completion for projects, and amplify digital value trading.  When poorly crafted, an API can be a serious negative success factor.  As the use of APIs becomes more important to an organization, so should API quality management.

Organizations launch API programs to support their digital transformation, provide integrated services as products, and improve their existing tech platforms.  As they do, they inevitably encounter challenges meeting API consumer expectations of consistency, intuitiveness, and quality.  As the program matures, its participants will begin to recognize the mutual dependency between API design elements defined in the creative process and the framework of tooling and automation used to build and deliver the products.
