RESTspec is an off-the-shelf, ready-to-adopt API design guideline for organizations building high quality, consistent API and web resource portfolios.

## Why RESTspec

API quality is important.  Well-crafted APIs are more useful and easier to work with.  They encourage adoption services, speed time-to-completion for projects, and amplify digital value trading.  When poorly crafted, an API can be a serious negative success factor.  As the use of APIs becomes more important to an organization, so should API quality management.

RESTspec enables an organization to more quickly achieve maturity in its API producer process and portfolio by providing a design guideline that may be adopted as-is or adjusted to meet the organization's goals.
